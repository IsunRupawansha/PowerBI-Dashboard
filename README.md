Data Modeling – Relationships were built and DAX measures created for KPIs and calculations.
Visualization – Key insights were represented with charts, tables, cards, and slicers for easy interaction.
Dashboard Interaction – Users can filter by categories, drill into trends, and monitor KPIs dynamically.
